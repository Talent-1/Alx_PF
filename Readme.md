# Lagos-Ibadan Rail Booking System Prototype

Welcome to the Lagos-Ibadan Rail Booking System, a prototype developed by **Team Byte by Byte** as part of the ALX Africa **GCGO (Global Challange, Global Opportunity)** challenge. This project aims to provide a functional and modern web-based solution for a national rail network, focusing on a seamless user experience from search to final payment.

This prototype demonstrates a complete front-end application, showcasing our team's proficiency in building interactive, data-driven web interfaces.

## **Features**

Our prototype includes the following key functionalities to simulate a real-world booking system:

- **Dynamic Booking Flow:** A complete user journey from selecting a destination and date to a successful booking confirmation.
- **Fare Classes:** Users can select between **Economy** and **First Class**, which dynamically updates prices and seat map layouts.
- **Dynamic Schedules:** The train schedule changes based on the selected departure date, providing a more realistic experience.
- **Interactive Seat Selection:** A visual seat map allows users to pick their preferred seats. The map displays available, selected, and booked seats.
- **Multiple Payment Options:** The system supports both **Card Payment** and an interactive **E-Wallet** with an integrated fund-loading feature.
- **Personalized User Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard displays a summary of the user's upcoming trip and a history of all past bookings, all stored locally in the browser.
- **Responsive Design:** The entire website is built to be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices. A hamburger menu is implemented for easy navigation on small screens.
- **Local Storage Integration:** All booking and e-wallet data persists even after the browser is closed, providing a realistic user experience without a backend.
